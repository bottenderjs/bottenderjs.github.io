Thanks to Babel, Node.js and the V8 engine, modern developers have escaped from call-back hell, but still have full access to the power of asynchronous error handling and state maintenance.</p>\\n<p>Also, bot development should be friendly. That is, developing bots on multiple messaging platforms should imply a consistent development experience without losing any of the characteristics or features of each platform.</p>\\n<p>Here comes Bottender, our proposal of modern and friendly bot development.</p>\\n<br />\\n<h2 id=\\\"only-javascript-handler-is-a-function\\\"><a href=\\\"#only-javascript-handler-is-a-function\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Only JavaScript.

You can still get the sender's profile with <code>context.session.user</code>.</p>\\n<p>If your LINE bot is connected to a <strong>LINE@ Approved account</strong> or an <strong>official account</strong>, you can access the group/room member IDs in <code>context.session.group</code> or <code>context.session.room</code>.
